# evernote-gtd-apple-scripts
These are some scripts I use day-to-day to automate some of the Evernote tag management associated with my 'Get Stuff Done' implementation. (<a href="http://www.thesecretweapon.org/the-daily-review" target="_blank">Read more here.</a>)

Note that you will need to update the scripts to correspond to the tagging and also notebook naming scheme you have used in your Evernote instance.
