# evernote-gtd-apple-scripts
These are some scripts I use day-to-day to automate some of the Evernote tag management associated with my 'Get Stuff Done' implementation. (http://www.thesecretweapon.org/the-daily-review)

Note that you will need to update the scripts to correspond to the tagging and also notebook naming scheme you have used in your Evernote instance.
